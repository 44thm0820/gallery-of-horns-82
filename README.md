# Lab 01-Class04-Day 4 of 4 day lab: Gallery of Horns

## Today's lab topic: Forms and Filter

## This readme provides an overview of the project for a new visitor to my repo

By the end of this week, I will create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow the user to filter the images by number of horns and choose his or her favorite image.

Today is the last day of my Gallery Of Horns. I have horned creatures displaying on the page. When I click on a beast, you increase its favorites and display it as a modal. Today I will be adding one more piece of functionality: filtering by numbers of horns.
